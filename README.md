# Student Course Capture GUI
## Prerequisites ##
This project was created in Java with JavaFX and SceneBuilder in Project SDK version 11.0.2 using IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition 2021.2.2.

This was the first of three projects as part of the Full Stack Applicaiton Development module at the University of Birmingham, focusing on front-end GUI development.

## Goal ##
The goal of this project is to create a GUI application based on the idea of a student capturing system using a Model-View-Controller layout as shown below:

![Model-View-Controller](https://github.com/khilankamlesh/Student-Course-Capture-GUI/blob/535e2e602f04ced934a0b02d9b1acffc3f2d8cfb/model-view-controller.png)

The program should be able to:
* Add students to the system when a ID, year of study and allocation of 3 module choices is entered
* Edit a student's allocation of modules
* Delete students from the system.

## Project Layout ##
* Extract FSDAssign1_Khilan_Kamlesh_2307483.zip and open folder as project in IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
* .fxml views files in Assignment1/src/main/resources
* Main and Controller .java files in src/main/java/fsd/assignment/assignment1/
* Asssignment1/student-data.txt contains all course information on currently stored students.
